Create a premium, luxurious, modern and highly professional real estate builder website inspired by leading brands like Veena Developers, Sunteck India and Kalpataru. The website should look rich, trustworthy and world-class, supporting the complete real estate industry workflow from brand awareness to customer enquiry, project discovery, booking assistance, legal transparency, customer experience and after-sales support. The homepage should contain a high-quality hero banner with lifestyle visuals, a strong brand tagline, brief introduction about the company, key highlights like projects delivered, experience and happy customers (placeholders only), along with a featured projects showcase carousel covering luxury, premium and aspirational segments. There must be strong call-to-action buttons like View Projects, Enquire Now, Schedule Site Visit and Download Brochure. The About Us section should highlight the builder’s mission, vision, values, leadership strength, construction quality standards, innovation mindset, reputation, customer-centric philosophy, awards, recognitions, CSR initiatives and sustainability commitment.

The Projects Module must be powerful and structured like top developers with separate sections for Ongoing Projects, Completed Projects, and Upcoming / Launching Soon Projects. Each project page must include a premium header, lifestyle introduction, location highlights, project benefits, available configurations, amenities list, floor plans, master layouts, gallery, virtual tours, RERA compliance note, possession timeline, price placeholders like “Starts from XX Lakhs onwards,” construction status updates, brochure download option, enquiry form, WhatsApp connect and Book Site Visit option. There should be a Coming Soon section for future projects with teaser banners, early interest forms and pre-launch engagement options. Completed projects should display success, brand trust and community experience through galleries and testimonials. The site must support a complete customer journey including easy enquiry capture, CRM integration, WhatsApp automation, callback requests, site visit booking, virtual tour booking, unit selection support, transparent payment schedule, home loan assistance, EMI calculator, bank tie-up information, agreement guidance, registration process explanation and post-booking customer updates.

There should be a Customer Experience / Testimonials section showing video reviews, written feedback, ratings and customer success stories along with a feedback submission form. A News, Events and Media section must cover brand announcements, press releases, launch events, celebrations, CSR activities and milestone updates. A Careers section must include company culture, available openings and an online job application form. A dedicated Support and FAQ section should solve customer doubts about booking, documentation, legal compliance, possession timelines and payments. Legal and compliance must include privacy policy, disclaimer, terms, booking guidelines, documentation requirements, transparency policy and RERA reference placeholders. The Contact section should include corporate address placeholder, phone placeholders, email placeholder, Google Map placeholder, enquiry form and callback feature.

The website must include modern features like chatbot, WhatsApp automation, CRM-based lead management, project download hub, construction progress tracker, SEO optimization, blazing fast performance, mobile responsive UI, visually rich design like Sunteck & Kalpataru websites, premium fonts, elegant animations and luxury feel. No real names, numbers, addresses, RERA IDs or actual sensitive data should be used — everything must remain placeholders. The final website should feel world-class, trustworthy, emotionally connecting, sales-focused, information-rich and completely aligned with how leading real estate developers operate today.
