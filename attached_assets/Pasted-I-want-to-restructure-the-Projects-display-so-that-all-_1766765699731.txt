I want to restructure the Projects display so that all projects are shown on the same page but clearly segregated by status, without mixing them. The page must contain three visually separate sections in proper order: Ongoing Projects, Completed Projects, and Upcoming Projects. Each section should have its own heading, spacing, and layout so users can instantly understand project status. In the Ongoing Projects section, display 4–5 residential and commercial projects currently under construction, each showing project name, project type, ONGOING status badge, full address (Kalyan, Maharashtra – Pincode 421306), RERA number, starting price or price per sq. ft., builder/tower name, multiple project images, walkthrough or promo video, full amenities list with individual images (gym, swimming pool, garden, clubhouse, parking, security), and nearby connectivity details such as hospital, metro, railway station, bus stop, and highway. In the Completed Projects section, display 4–5 fully delivered projects with COMPLETED status badge, completion year, final elevation and interior images, amenities provided, RERA verification number, location details, and a strong “Delivered Successfully” visual to build trust. In the Upcoming Projects section, display 4–5 upcoming or pre-launch projects with UPCOMING status badge, expected launch date, expected possession date, concept renders or teaser images, planned amenities with icons or images, full location details for Kalyan (421306), and a “Coming Soon” or “Pre-Register” call-to-action button. All three sections must exist on the same page, be fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop, use premium real-estate UI styling, have clearly visible color-coded status badges, smooth hover effects, and consistent card/grid layouts. Each section and page must have its own dedicated CSS file, images and videos must load from the assets folder, the code must be clean and production-ready, and the final output should look like a high-end Indian real estate developer website with clear project segregation and excellent user experience.
