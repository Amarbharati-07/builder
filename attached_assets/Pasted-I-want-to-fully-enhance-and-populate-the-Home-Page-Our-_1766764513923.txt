I want to fully enhance and populate the Home Page “Our Premium Projects” section with multiple real estate projects, displayed in a luxury, professional grid layout.

On the HOME PAGE, show at least 4–5 Residential projects and 4–5 Commercial projects, clearly categorized and filterable (Residential / Commercial). Each project card must show complete, real-world builder-level details.

For EACH PROJECT, include the following structured information and assets:

Project name

Project type (Residential or Commercial)

Status (Ongoing / Upcoming / Completed)

Full address (Kalyan, Maharashtra – Pincode 421306)

Landmark-based nearby connectivity (Hospital, Metro station, Railway station, Bus stop, Highway access)

Price range (₹ per sq. ft. or starting price)

RERA registration number (unique for every project)

Builder / Tower name

Under each project, add a dedicated project detail section that includes:

Multiple high-quality project images (tower view, elevation, interior, night view)

Project videos (walkthrough / drone / promotional)

Separate gallery for each project (images + videos)

Add a complete Amenities section for every project, where EACH amenity has its OWN IMAGE and label, including but not limited to:

Swimming Pool

Gym

Garden / Landscape

Children Play Area

Clubhouse

Security / CCTV

Parking

Amenities should be displayed in a clean grid layout with icons/images and proper titles.

Also include a Nearby Connectivity section per project showing distance and access to:

Hospital

Metro station

Railway station

Bus stop

Market / School

All projects must appear properly on the Home Page first, and clicking any project should open a detailed project page with all images, videos, amenities, RERA info, and location details.

Ensure:

Luxury real-estate UI design

Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop

Clean spacing, premium typography, and smooth hover effects

Each project is visually rich and well-structured

No placeholder-looking content

The Home Page must look like a top-tier real estate developer website, with complete project visibility, not minimal cards.
